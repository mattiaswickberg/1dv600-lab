# Project plan for library system

## Introduction
The project is to build the backend for a working library system from a framework supplied by the course managers. The work started in the end of January 2018, and the project is due March 18th 2018, although there will be a fall-back option later on during the spring in case the project plan fails and the time-frame needs to be extended. 

## Risk analysis

| Risk |Probability|Effects|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|Crisis at work means I won't have time for studies|Moderate|Catastrophic|
|Crisis in own life means I won't be able to complete project| Low | Catastrophic|
|Illness means I miss study time|Low|Serious|
|Time allotted for study isn't enough to finish project|Moderate|Serious|
|Complexity of project is underestimated|Moderate|Tolerable|
|Complexity of other course demands I take study time from this project|Moderate|Tolerable|
|Computer breaks down|Low|Tolerable|

Overall, the largest risks that I can see to me failing to complete this project is that my time will have to be devoted to my job instead of my studies - working full time as Lead Teacher at a school I've helped found means I tend to be the one having to jump in whenever something goes awry, and working with people, that tends to happen quite frequently. However, this time of year tends to be calmer that most, so hopefully I'll be able to only work full time and not more. 

The other risks are that I have underestimated the complexity, or overestimated the time I can give to this project, but I count those as more moderate risks, since they can be mitigated by reevaluating and reworking the plan.
