# Vision for library system

The system is supposed to be a library system, so the end vision must of course be a system which would help libraries in their day-to-day work of cataloguing, lending and retrieving books. 

This system  requires a few things for basic functionality from the client perspective. First of all, there needs to be a way of adding new books to the system, as well as modifying and deleting existing books. Each book needs to have a unique id to easily separate books from the same author or with identical titles, different printings of the same book or just multiple copies. Other than these, there need to be some fields to provide information about the nature of the book, such as genre. Since the system is, at least at this time, not aimed for commercial use, implementation of a standard library cataloguing system is not planned. A place for a description would however be helpful as well. The functions needed for this system to be working as a personal library is adding, removing, editing, and listing books both as a whole, and searching by author or title. 


## Current status
The status of the application as the project starts off is that the client side is finished and has an interface that will work, as well as an API for the server to work with. The server side is however non-functional, with only the very bare bone structure of code in place. 

## Stakeholder goals
The customer of a system like this wants a library system for personal use with the functionality stated above, within the dealine. 

Developer goals: Meet deadline, with functionality in place and a robust code base, tests and documentation that would allow for refactoring or expanding the system later. Also, pass the course. 

## Tasks
In each iteration of teh project:
- Plan the project
- Design the project
- Plan and write tests
- Implement functionality
- Make sure everything works
