# Vision for library system

The system is supposed to be a library system, so the end vision must of course be a system which would help libraries in their day-to-day work of cataloguing, lending and retrieving books. 

This system  requires a few things for basic functionality from the client perspective. First of all, there needs to be a way of adding new books to the system, as well as modifying and deleting existing books. Each book needs to have a unique id to easily separate books from the same author or with identical titles, different printings of the same book or just multiple copies. Other than these, there need to be some fields to provide information about the nature of the book, such as genre. The most natural way of doing this would naturally be to start with the Dewey Decimal system, but add some additional information, since I expect this system may have to work for both professional librarians and library visitors. A place for a description would probably be helpful as well. 

To meet the functionality needs for a library, there of course needs to be a way of telling whether this book is on loan or available, and perhaps a way of putting in a request for the book to be put on hold for a specific customer (though this may not be a required function, it would definitely be an advantage). Some statistics on how many times the book has been on loan would also be crucial for the library's evaluation processes. 

For economic purposes, it may be that the system needs to have information about the cost of the book (what the library bought it for), as well as the running cost, since libraries pay and get revenue based on the number of loans. This, however, may be hard to implement without proper research about the details of that system, especially if e-books are to be part of the system, since they range from ridicously expensive to just expensive for libraries to provide to customers.
