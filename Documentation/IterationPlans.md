# Plan for project stage
Project goal: Have a working library system with all basic functionality implemented. Basic functions are:
- View a book
- View a list of books
- Add a book
- Edit a book
- Delete a book
- Search a book by author or title (this one is optional)

Of the functions above, the view list of books, view book, and delete book are already implemented at this stage of development. Thus there are two functions that are imperative that they get finished, and then one that is optional, but needed for the project to feel complete. 

### Milestones:
Iteration 1 milestone: Add book function fully implemented and tested.  

Iteration 2 milestone: Edit book function fully implemented and tested

Iteration 3 milestone: Get book (by id) implemented.
Stretch Goal: Search for specific book fully implemented and tested, allowing search by both author and title.
