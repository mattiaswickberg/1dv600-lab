## Task 1
### Subtask A

The most complicated aspect of this task was really that I don't understand what the book object in the dao folder should be? In the end, I just made a file there and went on to create the book list in GetBooksResource. Again, I made the mistake of adding the book list to the callback to make it show on the website instead of console.log, so had to retrace and log it to the terminal instead. As always, the hardest part of any task is usually to actually understand what the task giver is saying/writing!


### Subtask B

Converting to JSON is the work of a few minutes, so not much problem with the work this time. 

Improvements: Firstly having a list of books in a function is really not a workable strategy for a site where you'll need to add new books through an interface, so first of all I need to separate my books from my functions, and then require that json file into my function. This is probably not good enough for the final version, but it's better than what's there now. 

Secondly, I need to comment my code so that I know what I'm doing, and add more details to my books.


### Subtask C
Really didn't need much time for this part, and I think maybe I should have come up with more complex improvements - however, without being quite sure what the requirements for the system is, I don't want to rush ahead with something major before I have implemented the basics thoroghly. I realise that my json file is very transitory, as there will be xml in the works, but still, it bugged me having a messy function.
